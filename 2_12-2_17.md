### 2:12 - 2:17 - Knowing proceeds Overcoming

#### Observations:

v12-14) I am writing to you/have written to you. Emphasis in changing the
writing/have written. Very lyrical, probably part of a hymn or he's making one
right here to be remembered through song.
  - Because your Sins have been forgiven
    - "On account of His name" - because of what Christ has done for them
  - Because you know who has been from the beginning
    - Walked with God and experienced God, have gained wisdom
    - Old Spiritually/Old Chronologically? Perhaps might be the elders and
    leadership?
  - Because you have overcome the evil one
    - Coming to Faith in Christ
    - "Young Men": IE. Of Military Age
    - Shoring them up, probably more likely to be taken out
    - The Victory and fight is also mostly theirs' to be made
    - Their strength comes from abiding in the word of God
  - Because you know the truth, because you have come to know the father
    - "Children" - Immature Children
    - Relationship with the Lord needs to be appreciated
  - Little Children: Pet term for the community, endearing.
  - A living, connected community that is deeply engaged in spiritual growth and
  getting to know god, and is also involved in a battle with the Evil One.

15-17) Do not love the World or the Things of the World
  - Written to Christians, so obviously there's an application there for them
  - Reasons why not to love the world:
    - Alienates you from the Love of the Father
    - The World is passing away
  - Kosmos: The Order/Age
  - Loving a system empowered by the Enemy of God is spiritual adultery
  - Lust of the Flesh (Cravings of Sinful Man)
    - Over-desire for things that Sinful, Un-regenerated Men Want
  - Lust of the Eyes
    - Everything that Entices
    - (Eros, Experiences, Entertainment, Things) - False promise for only what God can provide
  - Boastful pride of Life
    - Boasting of what he Has and Does
