# Introduction

Does not set up well for author, audience, third party. Not too much in
the way of autobiographical stuff.

Was written by John, not a lot of support for other theories that it was
written by his disciples. Written between 85-90AD. Some theories that it
was written against gnostic doctrine, but there are also other heresies
that he combats. The best guess is that there was a group of people who
had taken roman, pagan worship and had tried to purify it - old ideas
from roman mystery cults. Once they had received the Gospel, they had
reverted back to form and gone back to the old cults, and were trying to
pull other believers away from the fold.

Also some Docetism elements - saying that Jesus didn't have a physical
body. Others said that Jesus was a human being, but then Christ came and
took over his body and left. High amounts of synchrotism and mixing of
religions from all around the Roman empire, in addition to the Roman
cults.

Very pastoral letter, John was afraid that his people would be pulled
away from following the truth.
