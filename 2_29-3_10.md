* Not being surprised when the world does not know us (v2)
* Look forward to the Resurrection and your glorified Body (v2)
  * Accept the tension of the Already-Not Yet
* Focus on Christ is essential (v3)
  * This is the thing that makes you ceremonially clean and pure (G53,G48)
  * Emphasizing our distinctness as Christians

v4-10)
The present-tense verbs for "sin" and "practices Righteousness" indicates that
there is a difference between an occasional action of Sin and a lifestyle of
Sin that animates their lives. Believers instead, in being set apart, have a
principle of righteousness undergirding their lives, having a regenerated
spirit being distinct like the Son, are distinct from the World.

The true litmus test is that we are learning to love our brothers and that we
are in fact loving our brothers on a regular basis.
