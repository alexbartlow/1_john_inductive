### 2:18 - 2:23 - Identifying False Teachers

#### Context
Before: Knowing proceeds Overcoming
After: Abiding in Christ

#### Observation

v18: Antichrist & antichrists - Probably referring to some person who opposes
the work of Christ. (the opposer vs the 'instead of'?)
  - Last Hour: Implies urgency
  - also indicates that this is the final period of human history.
  - The presence of people who are types of the final Antichrist
    - indicates to us that we are living in a harsh period of history
    - v22: The antichrist is the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ. (cf. v18)

v19: Some of these false teachers have "come out of" the body of believers already
  - leaving the body of Christ does imply that they are opposed to the
  -the work of Christ. God used their leaving to reveal their heart motivations.

v20: You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know:
  - You are all filled with the Holy Spirit
  - and you can be more optimistic because
  - you have the HS encouraging you.
  - (And you have all knowledge)
  - you are capable of making these sorts of spiritual discernments
  - you can discern between false teachers because the Lord teaches you.

v21: I have written to you because you Do know the truth: 
  - Anyone with the Holy Spirit is capable of knowing the truth fully.
  - No lie is of the truth: There is nothing redeeming about false teaching

v23: The Father and the Son are One - packaged deal

#### Interpretation

Main Point: False Teachers are those who Deny the Son

- The Holy Spirit gives truth
- Truth is knowable for all believers
  - Believers are capable of spiritual Discernment
- The end of human history is real, implies a sense of urgency.
  - There will be an Antichrist
- The Father and the Son are One.
  - To know them is to have a relationship with them, you cannot truly know
    about God without knowing God personally.
- The real Body of Christ is a group of people with the Holy Spirit

#### Application

v19: God is never into people leaving the body of Christ for their own ends.

v21: The holy spirit teaches us the truth, and there is nothing to be hidden by
God anymore. Knowledge is received by revelation and not be secret knowledge
and secret words.
